# Password Generator

Welcome to the password generator! This webapge will help you generate passwords with randomly inserted characters of your choosing. 

You´ll be able to choose from four different type of characters:
* Upper case characters
* Lower case characters
* Numeric characters
* Special characters

## How It Works:

To initialize the page, click the Generate Password Button Button. 

Afterwards you will be prompted with the desired length of the password (your password must be bigger than 7 characters and shorter than 129 characters). Next we´ll have to validate which types of characters you want on said password; like the next image shows:

After selecting the desired prompts, your new password will be displayed on the text box below!
